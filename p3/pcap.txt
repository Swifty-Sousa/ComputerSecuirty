1. Multiple hosts sent packets on the local network. What are their MAC and IP addresses?
	IP: 10.0.2.15 MAC: 08:00:27:da:f7:f5
	IP: 10.0.2.3  MAC: 52:54:00:12:35:02

2. What type of network does this appear to be (e.g., a large corporation, an ISP backbone,
etc.)? Point to evidence from the trace that supports this.

3. One of the clients connects to a telnet server during the trace.
(a) What is the DNS hostname of the server it connects to?
	http://www.saix.net
(b) Based on the packet capture, what’s one major vulnerability of the telnet protocol?
	The username and password are passed in plaintext.
(c) What is a command run on the telnet server?
	After entering username and password, the "show ip bgp" command is run. 
(d) Name a network protocol that can be used in place of telnet to provide secure remote
login.
	Use SSH instead of telnet. 

4. The trace shows that at least one of the clients makes HTTPS connections. Pick one of these connections and answer the following:
(a) What is the domain name of the site the client is connecting to?
	www.yahoo.com
(b) Is there any way the HTTPS server can protect against the leak of information in (a)?
(c) During the TLS handshake, the client provides a list of supported cipher suites. List
the cipher suites and name the crypto algorithms used for each.
	Cipher Suites (23 suites)
   	Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0xc02b)

    	Cipher Suite: TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (0x0033)
    	Cipher Suite: TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (0x0032)
    	Cipher Suite: TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA (0x0045)
    	Cipher Suite: TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (0x0039)
    	Cipher Suite: TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (0x0038)
    	Cipher Suite: TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA (0x0088)
    	Cipher Suite: TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA (0x0016)

(d) Are any of these cipher suites worrisome from a security or privacy perspective? Why?
(e) What cipher suite does the server choose for the connection?
	Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0xc02f)

5. One of the clients is trying to use a search engine.
(a) Name the domain of the first search engine used.
(b) What is insecure about the search engine?
(c) Name something the user searched for
(d) How can users protect themselves against this type of attack?

6. What is the maximum number of years in jail that you could face under 18 USC § 2511 for
intercepting traffic on an encrypted WiFi network without permission?
